# Virtual-Tourist-Project

The app allows users to travel around the world virtually, and display photos for each location. The locations and photo albums will be stored in Core Data.
 The state of the map region and span is saved in UserDefaults.

The app has two view controller scenes:
* Travel Locations Map View: Allows the user to drop pins on the map
* Photo Album View: Allows the users to download and edit an album for a specific  location
